# Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting basically refers to rearranging a collection of data into ascending or descending order.
- It is helpful when we have to perform searching faster, or to identify similar items.
- Some algorithms make use of sorting as a key subroutine.

### Terms explained :

- In place: If only constant memory is required other than the input array.
- Stable : If the order of identical elements in the array is retained.
- Make sure to understand the difference between increasing and non-decreasing order.



## Bubble Sort

- It repeatedly loops through the array elements to be sorted and compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are not in order.
-  A point to note : After every n^th iteration, the n^th largest element reaches at its right place (if sorting in ascending order)
-  We can find if an array is sorted or not using bubble sort in one iteration itself.

### Algorithm

```

begin BubbleSort(array)
    for all items in array
        if array[i]>array[i+1]
            swap(array[i],array[i+1])
        end if
    end for

    return array

end BubbleSort

```

### Properties

- Time Complexity : O(n^2)
- Auxillary Space : O(1)
- In-place : Yes
- Stable : Yes

### Advantages

- Can be useful to sort nearly-sorted arrays.

### Disadvantage

- Too slow and impractical in most cases.

## Insertion Sort
- Insertion sort is a simple and efficient comparison sort.
- In this algorithm, each iteration removes an element from the input data and inserts it into the     
  correctposition in the list being sorted.
- The choice of the element being removed from the input is random and this process is repeated until
  all input elements have gone through.

## Algorithm
- If the element is the first element, assume that it is already sorted. Return 1.
- Pick the next element, and store it separately in a key.
- Now, compare the key with all elements in the sorted array.
- If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, then move to the next element.
  Else, shift greater elements in the array towards the right.
- Insert the value.
- Repeat until the array is sorted.

```
    void InsertionSort(int A[], int n) {
        int i, j, v;
        for (i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
          v=A[i];
           j= i;
          while (A[j-1]>v && j >= 1) {
            A[j] = A[j-1];
             j--;
            }
              A[j] = v;
            }
     }

## Properties
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) 
- Space Complexity: O(1)
 - In-place : Yes
- Stable : Yes

<a name="advantagesofinsertionSort"></a>

## Advantages
- Simple implementation
- Efficient for small data
- Practically more efficient than selection and bubble sorts, even though all of them
  have O(n^2) worst case complexity

<a name="disadvantageofinsertionSort"></a>

## Disadvantage

- Insertion sort is inefficient against more extensive data sets.


## Merge Sort

## Quick Sort

## Counting Sort

- Counting sort is a special sorting algorithm that sorts the multiple elements without performing any comparison. It counts the number of occurences of the various elements .This counting can be stored in a temporary array in which elements are marked as indexes and count of their occurences stored as values of the array .

<!-- citation : [Here](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/counting-sort)  -->


### Algorithm

```

begin countSort(arr, n)
    declare a count array of max range 256.
    mark all elements of the count array as 0.

    Run a for loop from i:=0 to i:=n-1 :
      compute the count of every element present in the array and store it at ith position of the count array.
    
    Run a for loop from i=1 to 256 :
      Convert the count array to prefix sum array by cummulative addding of previous elements.

    declare an output array of size n for storing the sorted sequence.

    Run a for loop from j:=n-1 to 0 :
      Insert the elments in the output using the count and original array, and Decrease  the count of each element restored by 1.

    Finally run a loop from i:=0 to i:=n-1 :
      Copy the values of output array into the original array.

  [end of program]
```

### Properties

- Time Complexity :
  - Worst case time	: O(n)
  - Best case time : O(n)
  - Average case time : O(n)
- Auxillary Space : O(n)
- In-place : No
- Stable : Yes

### Advantages

- Linear time sorting technique, making it faster than comparison based algorithms.

### Disadvantage

- Works for restricted inputs only for a certain range and takes extra space.
